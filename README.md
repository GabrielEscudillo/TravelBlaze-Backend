## Objective


This project embarked on the creation of a sophisticated API intricately woven with a versatile database, meticulously tailored to accommodate the diverse array of relationships pivotal to the TravelBlaze application's functionality.


## Description

Our backend system empowers users to seamlessly register, log in, and request appointments with our agents to plan their dream vacations. Furthermore, users can delve into the intricacies of their bookings, gaining comprehensive insights into their travel itineraries.

In addition, our platform enables agents to efficiently manage their daily appointments, facilitating meticulous planning and the delivery of top-notch services to clients. Agents also have the capability to create bookings, ensuring that users have access to their travel plans upon logging in.

Moreover, advanced functionalities cater to super admins, granting them the authority to list and delete users, appointments, and bookings. Furthermore, they possess the ability to onboard new agents, ensuring the seamless expansion of our elite team.

## DB Diagram

The diagram shows that each user will have a role assigned, which can be customer for clients, agent for workers, or superadmin for those responsible for managing the application.

On the other hand, each client can book an appointment with the travel agent of their choice, and the agents will be able to see all the appointments that have been booked with them.
